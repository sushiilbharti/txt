So git remote will come up and give us a list of all the remotes that it knows about. It doesn't know about any right now about. So it doesn't return anything. The git remote works a lot like git branch does. We use git branch to see all the branches, git remote shows us all the remotes that we know about. Now the next command we want to do is git remote add. So git remote add will add a remote and then what we want to put in. Don't type this part. Just wait for second. Git remote add and then the alias for what we want to name our remote followed by the URL of where it can find it.
